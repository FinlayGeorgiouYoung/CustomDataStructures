# CustomDataStructures
Project containing custom data structures I made as part of an assignment.

### Data Structures:
- **Binary Search Tree** - An integer only ordered binary tree, where everything to the left of a parent node is less than that node, and everything to the right is greater than that node. 
- **Priority Queue** - A collection of strings which have a priority associated with them, in the form of an integer. In this case the lowest number means highest priority, and therefore front of the queue. The priority numbers are currently bound by a range from 1 to 20, however this can be changed.
- **Word Tree** - A non-binary tree, which contains characters that make up the words added. Similar words use the same characters/nodes in the tree. For example, for "hey" and "hello", they both start with "he", and so will follow the same branch for the "h" and "e".
